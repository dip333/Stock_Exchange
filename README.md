## KNN Algorithm implementation in Python

Here the training data consist of two columns determining how the stock exchange performed on a particular
day between 2005 and 2009. The labels data provides the direction of the stock exchange for each
day of the training data. The test data consists of two columns for the year 2010.

### Testing and Training data
All testing and training data is under ./data directory.

*testing.csv* file has been created and all Direction column values have been calculated, so we will be able to calculate the accuracy of KNN each time.
